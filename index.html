                <h3>The Path Ahead</h3>
                <p>Game jam project completed with a friend in just 4 days. Emphasized teamwork, planning, and rapid prototyping. Taught me to keep code readable and efficient.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-card">
                <h3>Q-Learning RL Blackjack Agent</h3>
                <p>Developed a basic reinforcement learning agent to learn whether to hit or stay in blackjack. Used computer vision to read dealt cards and trained the agent using Q-learning principles. Explored AI, CV, and decision-making logic.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-card">
                <h3>Push Up Counter</h3>
                <p>Developed a basic push up counter that counts how many push ups you do using computer vision. Used teachable machines to train a simple model of when someone is in the up or down position of a pushup.</p>
